Definition: A blocking process stops further execution until a certain condition is met.
Effect: If an action or process is blocking, it prevents further actions, such as pushing changes or making edits, until a requirement is satisfied.
Example: In GitHub Actions, a blocking workflow waits for certain conditions (like code review, CI checks, or deployments) to complete before allowing you to push changes.
